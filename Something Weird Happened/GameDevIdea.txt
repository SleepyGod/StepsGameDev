RPG
Story Driven Leveling; EndGame-Grind, Raids/Dungeons and public events

Player will only be able to travel to another Reality after a massive story event. (Early-Mid Story)

Environment:
Multi Dimension Maps with different versions of a single world, this includes
Raids and Dungeons (part of the game mechanics where the player has to switch
between realities to finish a single task...).

Early GEnv(1st Reality):
- Green Plains, calm/warm setting, mostly passive mobs.

GEnv (2nd Reality):
- Psycadelic world, purple tones, 50/50 on mob aggressiveness.

GEnv (3rd Reality):
- Spirit Realm, dark place overall... this is where people of the first realm go
when they "die". No mobs, only 1 boss(Also an EndGame-Raid, boss becomes OP by then).

GEnv (4th Reality):
- White Space(or is it?)(Special Raid-Item Driven space)

Crafting System Idea:
-  Different weapon parts means a new world of customization...
   based on base material, which will determine the main weapon-stats and main weapon-color;
